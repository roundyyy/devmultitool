DevMultiTool for Unity is a set of tools that can help you to make boring tasks faster by performing batch operations on game objects. With this tool, you can focus on development and spend less time on doing repetitive stuff. About 30 different editor tools that I find useful in my work (some more, some less)

## Features

### Batch Operations

DevMultiTool provides several batch operations that can be performed on game objects. These include:

- Moving, cloning, replacing etc.
- Adjusting position, rotation, and scale of game objects
- Sorting game objects by name, material etc.
- Setting layer and tag for multiple game objects

### Optimization Tools

DevMultiTool also includes some tools for optimizing your Unity projects. These include:

- Material Baker. It will bake cheap version of your materials, so it can be used for lower LOD levels
- LOD tweaker

### Scene Management

DevMultiTool provides features to make working with large scenes easier.
